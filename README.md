Here, as in an RPG game, it is about doing something (e.g. killing a monster, completing a task) and
gaining experience and increasing the player's level.

Why is it called Real Life RPG? Right, because the "monsters" you kill here are actually things that
you will do them in **your** real life.

Specifically, it's about things you learn and/or things that improve **your life** - read a book, do a
fitness workout, follow a tutorial.

At the moment it is mainly made to suit my tastes, but in the future it should be possible to
dynamically add the kinds of experiences that are relevant to the individual player.

By the way, the levels are not numerical ( Level 1, Level 2, etc.), but the military ranks
of the Austrian Armed Forces, from private to general - in German, of course.
